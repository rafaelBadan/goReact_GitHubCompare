# Rocketseat Bootcamp

[Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamps) is focused on NodeJS, React and React Native. It is based on hands-on development of several apps with different approaches, from MVC with templating views (nunjucks), to REST APIs with React and React Native front-end consuming those APIs.

# The Git Compare App

It's basically an app focused on comparing GitHub repos considering main stats.

The app makes use of [localStorage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp), so the repositories added by you to the dashboard will be kept in your browser, even if you close the page.
